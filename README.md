##### Employ pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to perform inference on a dataset containing Pok√©mon images and their corresponding metadata, facilitating the exploration of relationships between images and textual descriptions.

##### Leverage t-SNE for visualizing clusters of images, enhancing the intuitive comprehension of similarities and distinctions among them.
